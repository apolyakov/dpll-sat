## Overview
This project is a part of Mathematical Logic course. The aim of the project is to learn how a simple SAT-solver works and implement
the own one using Tseitin transformation to convert propositional logic formulas to CNF (conjunctive normal form) and DPLL algorithm
to check whether the formula is satisfiable or not.

## Requirements
Your Python version should be at least 3.6 to use the solver. To address additional packages requirements you may just run `pip3 install --requirement requirements.txt`.

## Usage
Run `python src/sat_solver.py -h` for the detailed explanation.

## Running samples
Run 'python samples/example_sample.py -h' for the detailed explanation.
